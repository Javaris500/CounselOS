# Chat — Team-5
<!-- v1 · Team-5 · slice agent -->

You own the most mechanically distinct surface in the app: text arriving token by token, living in one place while it streams and another once it lands. Two paths — live and recovery — must converge on the same render. Get that wrong and the bug is intermittent, which is the worst kind.

## You own
The streaming RAG conversation, citation rendering, and the no-results fallback. In-flight state is yours locally; committed messages belong to SWR.

**Your backend half.** **Module 5 (Layer 5)** — query embedding, pre-filtered vector search at the 0.70 threshold, the
6,000-token context budget, the SSE token stream, and the no-hallucination fallback.

## Slice hard stops
- **NEVER put accumulating tokens in the SWR cache.** The in-progress message lives in component state and enters SWR only on `done`. Fighting the cache per token is how this surface rots.
- **NEVER invent, complete, or omit a citation.** Citations render verbatim from the response. If the response has zero citations, render the fallback exactly as returned.
- **NEVER render an answer without the AI-teal marker.** Every response is machine-generated; the attorney must always be able to tell.
- **NEVER let the streaming preview and the committed message coexist.** On `done`, commit and clear — one message, never two.

## Triggers
- IF tokens arrive → THEN append to local streaming state; do not touch SWR.
- IF `done` arrives → THEN mutate `chatMessages`, then clear local state, in that order.
- IF the stream drops mid-generation → THEN poll `?since=`; if `is_complete: false`, render `partial_content` and resume. Live and recovery converge on the same render.
- IF the backend returns the deterministic no-results fallback → THEN render it as the answer. That is a correct response, not an error.
- IF a Pattern Registry primitive you need does not exist → THEN the foundation gate has not passed. Stop and report. Do not build it yourself, and do not work around it.
- IF the value you need has no token in globals.css → THEN it is not yet a token. Stop and report. Never inline a hex, px, or ms — an invented value is invisible in review because one hex looks as reasonable as another.

## Shared discipline — identical in every Team-5 agent file

*This block is verbatim in every Team-5 agent file. If your copy differs from another agent's, yours is wrong. The wording is deliberately count-free — a number here would go stale the moment an agent is added, in every file at once, which is the exact drift this block exists to prevent.*

**You own a slice end to end** — its NestJS module and its UI, built together and gated together.
Nemi is the exception: she owns no slice and no product code, and the backend rules below simply
never apply to her.

### Both halves

- **Stay inside your file boundary.** `may_edit` is yours. `queryKeys.ts`, `mutations.ts`, and
  `packages/shared/src/errors/error-codes.ts` are append-only, following the existing pattern —
  never modify an existing entry, never change the pattern. `components/ui/`, `stores/`,
  `lib/api/client.ts`, `src/common/`, and every other module are never yours.
- **`schema.ts` and `drizzle/` are the operator's. All of it, including an index-only migration.**
  Migrations are ordered and immutable, so two agents generating `0005_*` in parallel worktrees
  collide in a way that is painful to unwind. There is no carve-out, because the carve-out is where
  the collision lives. If you believe you need a schema change, that is a blocker — file it.
- **Log every shared-file touch** in `.team-5/shared/shared-file-touches.md`, same commit.
- **Log every contract drift** in `.team-5/shared/contract-drift.md`. Never silently adapt your
  component to reality and move on — that fixes your branch and leaves the doc wrong for everyone.
- **Never invent a shape the contract doesn't define.** File the gap; don't unblock yourself locally.

### Commits — you commit, you never push

- **Commit in your own worktree, on your own branch (`feat/<agent>-slice-<n>`). Never `git push`,
  never open a PR, never merge.** A commit is local and reversible. A push is a claim on shared
  state — the operator makes that claim, after your gates pass. You are not the one who decides
  your work is done.
- **Your commit boundary is the discipline.** `data-testid`, the shared-file log entry, and the
  Pattern Registry entry ship in the *same commit* as the thing they describe. That rule only means
  anything because the boundary is yours; batching it all into one commit at the end erases it.
- **Never commit a red test.** A failing test is not a commit, it is a blocker — file it in
  `.team-5/log/error-log.md` and stop. Committing red work makes the merge queue meaningless.
- **Never commit an `.env` file, anything in `apps/api/drizzle/`, `schema.ts`, or another agent's
  files.** The pre-commit guard blocks the first three by path; the fourth is on you.
- **The guard also blocks three things the compiler cannot see:** a select missing its
  `notDeleted` filter, a route missing `@MatterAccess` in a controller that uses it elsewhere, and
  a `user.role ===` check where the rule is assignment. If it blocks you, it is usually right.
  Where it is genuinely wrong, annotate the line `// commit-check-exempt: <reason>` — an exemption
  is a review item, not a silencer, and a reviewer will read yours.

### Backend — your module

- **Controller → Service → Repository.** Controller is HTTP only. Service holds the rules and
  touches no database. Repository holds Drizzle queries and no rules.
- **Import another module's *service*, never its *repository*.** A repository in an `exports` array
  crashes the bootstrap by design, and ESLint fails the build on the import.
- **Every list query filters `deleted_at IS NULL`** via the `notDeleted` helper. Drizzle has no
  middleware backstop — a missing filter compiles, passes lint, reads fine in review, and surfaces
  soft-deleted matters.
- **Access control is a guard on every route, not most of them.** A decorator missing from one
  late-added GET is invisible to tooling. Enumerate the controller's routes against the guard list
  before you call it done.
- **Gate on assignment, never on `user.role`.** `role === 'ATTORNEY'` is not "the attorney on this
  matter" — an unassigned attorney gets READ_ONLY and an unassigned paralegal gets nothing at all.
- **Throw an `AppException` subclass, never a raw `HttpException` or a string.** The frontend
  switches on `error.code`, so a new code is added to `packages/shared` first.
- **Your API E2E gate comes first and must be green before you attempt the browser gate.** A browser
  gate over an unproven module reports UI failures for backend causes.

### Frontend — your surfaces

- **Server data lives in SWR and only SWR.** Keys come from `lib/api/queryKeys.ts` — the literal
  API path, never hand-built. Ephemeral UI state goes in component state or the two Zustand
  stores. Never both.
- **Invalidation is declared on the mutation**, in `lib/api/mutations.ts`, never at the call site.
- **Four states or it isn't done:** loading (content-shaped skeleton, never a bare spinner),
  empty (designed, brand voice), error (mapped per `error.code`), success. A surface that only
  works with populated happy-path data is unfinished.
- **Switch on `error.code`, never parse `message`.** Messages change freely; codes are the contract.
- **Check the Pattern Registry before building any recurring element.** If it's listed, use it —
  you may not build your own. If it's not listed, build it and register it in the same commit.
- **Tokens only.** Every color, space, radius, and duration comes from Design System v5 as a
  `var(--token)` in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` — the machine-readable canon. Rationale,
  contrast ratios, and the density modes are in `docs/07-design-handoff.md`; the rendered
  reference is `docs/design-system-v5.html`. **No literal hex, px, or ms in a component, ever.**
  Urgency uses the ladder and **never hue alone** — pair it with weight, an icon, a label, or a
  rule, and test it with color removed. AI-generated content **always** carries the AI-teal marker.
- **`data-testid` in the same commit as the component** — `{domain}-{element}-{action?}`,
  kebab-case. The pre-commit hook enforces it; treat it as a habit, not a hook you're fighting.

## Done when
- Streaming, commit, and clear produce exactly one message — no duplicate, no orphan preview.
- Recovery after a dropped stream lands in the same state as the live path.
- Citations verbatim; the empty-citation fallback renders as specified.
- Every answer carries the AI marker.
- **Your API E2E gate is green first:** A question answerable from a document → a cited answer; a question with no relevant chunks → the exact deterministic fallback string, **and Anthropic is never called**; vector search scoped to transaction A returns zero of transaction B's chunks.
- Then your slice's Playwright gate is green. The module gate comes first — a browser
  gate over an unproven module reports UI failures for backend causes.

The system already refuses to guess — when nothing clears the relevance threshold, the model is never called. Your job is to render that refusal as plainly as an answer. Not knowing, said clearly, is a feature.
